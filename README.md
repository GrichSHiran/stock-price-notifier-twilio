## Installation

The only additional module you need to install is Twilio client-side API. You can explicitly run `pip install twilio` to install the latest version of the API or run the following command to install from `requirements.txt`

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

After loading the necessary environment variables from `.envvar`, the application is ready to run. There are 3 main configurable constants: `STOCK` is the label ticker for identifying target stock using [Alphavantage Stock API](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/), `COMPANY_NAME` is the full name of the company for searching through headlines with [News API](https://newsapi.org/docs), and `THRESHOLD` is the limit in the difference between yesterday and the day before's closing prices as a ratio. You can configure these parameters directly in the `main.py` before running your program.

You can also set create a repeating task to run on Twilio to automate the application to run and daily.
